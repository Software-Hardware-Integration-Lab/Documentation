# Overview

The AppLocker Managed configuration is designed to configure Microsoft AppLocker Managed Installer (MI) on installation.

Some of the example configurations that the app performs include managing the Microsoft Edge Updater, Microsoft Teams Updater, and Intune. By utilizing the power of AppLocker MI, the app can ensure that only approved applications are installed and run on the system, thereby enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

Overall, this app is a valuable tool for any organization or individual seeking to tighten their security measures and control the applications that are installed on their systems. With its ability to configure and manage AppLocker MI, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing application security, and its automatic removal of all associated configurations upon uninstall ensures that there are no lingering security holes left behind.
