# Deployment

Data Gateway does not require deployment steps in your tenant.  
The service is hosted by SHI and is available directly via the UI and API.

To get started:

- Sign in with your Entra ID account.  
- Navigate the [Usage Guide](../Usage-Guide/index.md) for common tasks.  
- See [Reference](../Reference/index.md) for API integration details.
