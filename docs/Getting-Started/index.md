# Overview

To use the app, two primary deployments must happen: the server and the architectural core infrastructure.
The server is deployed first then the server deploys the core infrastructure.

1\. To deploy the server, chose from one of the below deployment methods:<br>
[Deploy Using Azure Marketplace :simple-microsoftazure:](Deployment/Azure-Marketplace/){ .md-button }
[Deploy Using Manual Method :fontawesome-solid-file-zipper:](Deployment/Manual-Deployment/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

2\. Deploy the core infrastructure using the Web UI:<br>
[Deploy Core Infrastructure :octicons-rocket-24:](Usage-Guide/Deploy-Core-Infrastructure/){ .md-button }

3\. Manage your infrastructure using the MSM app's Lifecycle management engine:<br>
[Manage Lifecycle :fontawesome-solid-rotate:](#){ .md-button }
