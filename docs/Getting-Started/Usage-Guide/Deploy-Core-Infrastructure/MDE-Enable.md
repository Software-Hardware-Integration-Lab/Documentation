# Defender for Endpoint - Workspace Creation

The first time Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's (MDE) UI is loaded, it creates a workspace to store all of the security, usage, and telemetry data.

This automated workspace provisioning process can be completed by navigating to the [Microsoft 365 Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com){:target="_blank"} and selecting the devices tab on the left.

If the list of devices in table format loads, the workspace has already been set up.

If you get a splash screen saying the workspace/MDE is being set up, please wait until the process has completed. After the splash screen disappears, MDE is fully initialized in the tenant.
