# Unassign User

Privileged devices (PAWs) use credential partitioning to prevent unexpected credentials from being stored or used on them.  
User Assignments achieves this requirements on the PAWs. User assignments allows only the specified user(s) to log onto the specific privileged device.

Un-assigning a user removes that user(s) from being allowed to sign into the specified workstation.
The user un-assignment process also removes the requested user(s) from the Hyper-V admin role.

## Process

1\. Select the `Privileged` security class from the top bar.

2\. Press the `Manage` button in the `User Assignments` column.

3\. Select the list of users that you would like to un-assign from the PAW.
