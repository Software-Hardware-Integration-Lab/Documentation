# Reference

This page provides a complete reference for the Discover module, including plugins, schema, licensing models, and core configuration expectations.

---

## Plugin Overview

Discover uses a plugin architecture to retrieve data from Microsoft 365 services. Each plugin is executed independently, and the results are standardized before being uploaded to the Azure SQL database.

### Included Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EntraID** | Retrieves directory settings, user roles, and licensing scope |
| **Defender for Endpoint** | Collects device configurations and security compliance mappings |
| **Defender for Identity** | Evaluates privileged identity policies, alerts, and audit logic |

ðŸ“– Plugin logic is described in the [Execution Flow Diagram](index.md#execution-process)

---

## Database Schema

All data collected by Discover is stored in an Azure SQL Database. The core tables include:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Correlation` | Top-level run metadata and timestamp linkage |
| `LicenseData` | All license configuration results |
| `Results` | Engine output for each plugin and validation step |

For full structure and table relationships, see the [Schema Documentation](Database-Schema.md)

## Supported Licenses

Discover analyzes how Microsoft 365 licenses are configured and applied. This includes SKUs across all verticals:

- Enterprise (E1, E3, E5)
- Education (A1, A3, A5)
- Government (G1, G3, G5)
- Frontline (F1, F3)

ðŸ“– License breakdown and mappings: [Supported Licenses](Supported-Licenses.md)

---

## Reserved Principals

Some Entra ID accounts are marked as reserved and should not be altered by automation. Discover recognizes these automatically and excludes them from plugin evaluations.

ðŸ“– See list of principals in: [Reserved Principals](Reserved-Principals.md)

---

## Azure SQL Configuration

Discover requires an Azure SQL Database for storing its results. Refer to [Deployment â†’ Azure SQL Setup](Deployment.md#azure-sql-configuration) for setup steps.

To automatically configure permissions via PowerShell:

```powershell
Add-AzLicenseDb -SubscriptionId '<sub-id>' -ReadGroupId '<read-group-id>' -WriteGroupId '<write-group-id>'
```

```powershell
Get-Help -Name 'Add-AzLicenseDb' -Full
```
