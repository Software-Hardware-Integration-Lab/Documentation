This page provides a complete reference for the Discover module, including plugins, schema, licensing models, and core configuration expectations.

## Plugin Overview

Discover uses a plugin architecture to retrieve data from Microsoft 365 services. Each plugin is executed independently, and the results are standardized before being uploaded to the Azure SQL database.

### Included Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EntraID** | Retrieves directory and user-level settings |
| **Defender for Endpoint** | Retrieves licensing status |
| **Defender for Identity** | Retrieves licensing status |

ðŸ“– Plugin logic is described in the [Execution Flow Diagram](./Architecture/Process-Flow.md)

## Supported Licenses

Discover analyzes how Microsoft 365 licenses are configured and applied. This includes SKUs across all verticals:

- Enterprise (E1, E3, E5)
- Education (A1, A3, A5)
- Government (G1, G3, G5)
- Frontline (F1, F3)

ðŸ“– License breakdown and mappings: [Supported Licenses](../Supported-Licenses.md)

## Reserved Principals

Some Entra ID accounts are marked as reserved and should not be altered by automation. Discover recognizes these automatically and excludes them from plugin evaluations.

ðŸ“– See list of principals in: [Reserved Principals](Reserved-Principals.md)
