# Reference

This reference page for the Defend module provides a comprehensive view of all supporting technical material that underpins lifecycle management operations, including:

- Hardware requirements for each security class
- Full lifecycle diagrams for devices and users
- Notes on privileged workflows
- Relevant configuration examples

All information here is specific to the Defend module and complements the main [Usage Guide](../Usage-Guide/index.md).

## Hardware Requirements

SHIELD enforces hardware baselines per security class, especially for **Privileged Security Mode (PSM)**, to reduce the risk of compromise through firmware, bootkits, and untrusted supply chains.

### Enterprise and Specialized Modes (ESM/SSM)

| Requirement        | Recommendation                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OS                | Windows 10 or later                         |
| RAM               | 16GB or more                                |
| OEM Devices       | Microsoft Surface or Lenovo preferred       |
| Graphics Support  | NVIDIA recommended (avoid AMD graphics)     |

!!! info "Device Security Considerations"
    In ESM/SSM, hardware risks are lower, but itâ€™s still important to avoid unsupported OEMs and poor firmware hygiene. These devices typically handle non-elevated tasks.

### Privileged Mode (PSM)

| Requirement        | Recommendation                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OS                | Windows 11 Secure Core Certified             |
| CPU               | Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 7 equivalent         |
| RAM               | 32GB recommended (16GB minimum)             |
| Storage           | 256GB+ NVMe SSD                             |
| Certification     | [Secure Core Certified](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/business/windows-11-secured-core-computers) |

!!! warning "Potential Hardware Backdoors"
    Avoid OEMs that allow firmware-level master password resets or silent security bypasses. SHIELD recommends only certified hardware from Microsoft and Lenovo for PSM operations.

## Lifecycle Workflow Diagrams

Each SHIELD lifecycle action is mapped to a standardized backend workflow. The following flowcharts show the logic for each user and device operation.

## Privileged Workflows (Coming Soon)

A dedicated section for advanced Privileged workflows, including intermediary logic and RBAC extensions, will be added in a future release.
