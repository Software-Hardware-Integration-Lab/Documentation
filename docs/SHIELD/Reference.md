## Hardware Requirements

Hardware requirements for SHIELD vary by security level.

### ESM & SSM (Enterprise/Specialized Security Modes)

| Requirement | Recommended |
|-------------|-------------|
| OS | Windows 10 or later |
| RAM | 16GB or higher |
| OEMs | Microsoft Surface, Lenovo |
| Graphics | NVIDIA preferred (no AMD) |

!!! info "Device Security Notes"
    Risk of firmware-level threats is lower in ESM/SSM. Still, choose reputable OEMs and avoid unsupported firmware.

### PSM (Privileged Security Mode)

| Requirement | Recommended |
|-------------|-------------|
| OS | Windows 11 Secure Core Certified |
| CPU | Intel i7 / Ryzen 7 or better |
| RAM | 32GB (16GB minimum) |
| Storage | 256GB NVMe |
| Certification | [Secure Core Certified](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/business/windows-11-secured-core-computers) |

!!! warning "Hardware Backdoor Risk"
    Avoid OEMs known to support master password removal or insecure firmware (e.g., older Dell, HP, Samsung). Prioritize Secure Core Certified devices from trusted vendors.
