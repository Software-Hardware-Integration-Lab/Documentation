# Debug Mode

Debug mode exposes additional data and endpoints that can be used for troubleshooting the app.
This can be consumed by an admin or by another dev.
Enabling debug mode is a security risk, only enable it in a dev environment with minimal permissions as bad things can happen if threat actors find it.
