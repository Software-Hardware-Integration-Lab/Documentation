## Overview

Moot Security Management (MSM) is an orchestration tool that simplifies the deployment, management, and maintenance of Microsoft's Securing Privileged Access (SPA) architecture. With MSM, you can automate the deployment of complex security infrastructures, device management, and user management while adhering to security best practices. MSM helps organizations to reduce the time and expertise required for deployment from a year or more to just a few minutes.

## Audience

This documentation is primarily intended for technical users who are responsible for the deployment, management, and maintenance of security infrastructures. However, the documentation is designed to be accessible to non-technical users as well.

## Key Features and Benefits

MSM comes with a range of features that simplify the deployment and management of complex security infrastructures. Some of the key features and benefits of MSM are:

- Automate the deployment of complex security infrastructures
- Manage devices, users, intermediaries, and server/interfaces with ease
- Adhere to security best practices
- Reduce maintenance efforts

## MSM in the Security Landscape

MSM is an orchestration tool in the larger security landscape. It does not bring new security functionality, but instead automates the tools that already exist. MSM operates as an orchestrator for the rest of the security landscape, simplifying the deployment and management of complex security infrastructures.

## Prerequisites

To use MSM, you must have the following:

- Microsoft `E5`, `A5`, `G5`, `F3` + `F5 Security & Compliance` or equivalent (known collectively as `M5` for ease of writing/communication) licensing for privileged and specialized security levels
- Microsoft `M3` licensing level as a minimum for enterprise security class

## Recommended Environment

While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to use MSM in the following environment:

- An `Azure Subscription` for hosting the application, as it is a security best practice to run the app in Azure
- All objects to be managed by MSM (devices, users, apps, etc.) synced/connected to Azure AD, the primary identity provider used by MSM

By following these recommendations, you can speed up the adoption process for MSM.

## Conclusion

MSM simplifies the deployment, management, and maintenance of complex security infrastructures by automating the tools that already exist. With MSM, you can reduce the time and expertise required for deployment, manage devices and users with ease, adhere to security best practices, and reduce maintenance efforts.

In the rest of the documentation, we will provide detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and use MSM to achieve these benefits.
