# Usage Guide

This guide explains how to operate SUS once it's been deployed.
It covers the creation of a vanity URL pointing to a target of your choice.

Log into your associated [Microsoft Work or School account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/what-s-the-difference-between-a-microsoft-account-and-a-work-or-school-account-72f10e1e-cab8-4950-a8da-7c45339575b0) on the top right corner.

![LogIn](../assets/Images/SUS/Login-Light.png#only-light){ loading=lazy }
![LogIn](../assets/Images/SUS/Login-Dark.png#only-dark){ loading=lazy }

In the dropdown, select the domain that will be associated with the vanity/short URL that you wish to create. For the purpose of this guide, the domain name is pointing to `url.shilab.com`.

![Domain](../assets/Images/SUS/DomainUrl-Light.png#only-light){ loading=lazy }
![Domain](../assets/Images/SUS/DomainUrl-Dark.png#only-dark){ loading=lazy }

The target URL is the the full destination address that the vanity URL redirects to. It represents the actual location of the content or resource, such as a website, document, or application.

For example: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/overview`.

![Target](../assets/Images/SUS/TargetUrl-Light.png#only-light){ loading=lazy }
![Target](../assets/Images/SUS/TargetUrl-Dark.png#only-dark){ loading=lazy }

The vanity URL is the customizable, human-readable identifier used to create a short, memorable link that redirects to a longer or more complex destination URL. Do note that the name has to be globally available, duplicate names are not supported.

For example: `spa`.

![Vanity](../assets/Images/SUS/VanityUrl-Light.png#only-light){ loading=lazy }
![Vanity](../assets/Images/SUS/VanityUrl-Dark.png#only-dark){ loading=lazy }

After filling out all three, push the save button. It will create the vanity URL with your choice of options.

You can see the list of Vanity Names and the associated Destination. Under Action, you have the ability to view and track the QR code that was generated. It is a scannable code that encodes the vanity URL, allowing users to quickly access the target URL by scanning an image. It enhances accessibility and ease of sharing, especially in printed materials or presentations.
